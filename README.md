# 🕵️‍♂️ x86 Assembly Debugger Detection  
A low-level x86 Assembly program that detects debugging tools using classic anti-analysis techniques such as trap flag checks, INT 3 behavior, timing attacks, and memory breakpoint testing.

This project demonstrates real malware analysis & reverse engineering concepts.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Detects if CPU Trap Flag is manipulated  
✔ Detects INT 3 breakpoint behavior  
✔ Detects single-step debugging  
✔ Detects timing anomalies (RDTSC)  
✔ Detects memory breakpoints  
✔ Prints result to screen (debugger present / not present)
